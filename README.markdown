This was a quick hack to produce a feed of the pictures
from Cute Overload without the creepy babytalk text.

It stopped working when I moved web hosting to a place
that doesn't run cronjobs.  I had stopped reading it
long before that, and I'd only kept it going out of a
sense of obligation to the other readers.  Sorry.
